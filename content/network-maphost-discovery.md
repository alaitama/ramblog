Network mapping for discover hosts and topology in a LAN. Is the
previous step for tapping in the web or attack a host.

There are many tools fot this. I remember two good tools in my times,
[Iris][], [Retina,][] not free and I don't know how are good now.Â But
with NMAP you can do this.

For view the hosts in company lan:  
`nmap -sL 10.0.0.0/8`  
Too much hosts, I try the next command for less hosts. This limits to
the subhost 10.15.255.255(1+2+4+8) :  
`nmap -sL 10.0.0.0/12`  
Or in a personal LAN we could do:  
`nmap -sL 192.168.1.0/24`
